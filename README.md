# python-api-challenge
In this project, I used two different API's to import data about weather around the world. I wanted to look at things like wind speed, humidity, cloud cover, and max temperature in order to answer questions about how Lattitude effects weather.  After this, I used this data in conjunction with an API called "Google Places" to identify cities and hotels in places around the world that had ideal conditions for a hypothetical vacation I mightt want to take.

In the first part of the project I was able to discern a few trends about how lattitude effects weather.
  1. The first trend I noticed was that in the Northern Hemisphere, the greater the lattitude the lower the max temperature is. This makes sense because in tropical places along the equator the temperature seems to stay consistently warm. In the Southern Hemisphere the opposite is true and as Lattitude increases, the max temperature decreases.
  2. Another trend I noticed was that in the northern hemisphere and in the southern hemishere there does not seem to be a linear relationship between cloud cover and lattitude
  3. Lastly, regardless of the hemisphere there also does not seem to be a strong linear relationship between wind speed and lattitude
